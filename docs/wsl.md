# Setting Up Unix Computing Environment on Windows 10 with WSL

WSL, or _Windows Subsystem for Linux_, is a subsystem that allows
users to run a Unix computing environment within Windows 10.  This
is the recommended method for having a local Unix computing 
environment for your Windows 10 machine, for the purpose of
CS1010, CS2030, CS2030S, and CS2040 in Semester 1, AY2020/21.

There are two versions, WSL 1 and, a newer, WSL 2. 

For the Unix@Home workshop, it suffices for attendees
to install WSL 1.

## Requirements

Before you proceed with the instructions below, you need to make sure that:

- You have 64-bit versions of Windows 10, version 1607 or higher 
([Here is how you check](https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/13443/windows-which-version-am-i-running));

- You have administrator access to your Windows 10; And

- You have an SoC Unix account. You can [create an SoC Unix account here](https://mysoc.nus.edu.sg/~newacct).  For SoC students, this username is something that sticks with you for the rest of your SoC life -- so choose wisely.

## Installing WSL 1

### Step 1: Enabling WSL on Windows 10 through PowerShell

Before you install WSL 1, you need to first enable the "Windows Subsystem for Linux" feature by running the following command in PowerShell.

```PowerShell
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
```

You can achieve this step by:

- Hit ++win++ to open the Start menu, type `PowerShell`, then right-click on Windows PowerShell, and click "Run as administrator"
- Copy the command above by selecting it and then hitting ++ctrl+c++
- Go to your PowerShell window and paste the command above by hitting ++ctrl+v++.  Press enter if needed to run the command. 

### Step 2: Restart your computer

### Step 3: Install Ubuntu 

After restarting your computer, go to the <a href="https://aka.ms/wslstore">Microsoft Store</a> and get <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N9TNGVNDL3Q">Ubuntu</a> 18.04.

Follow the on-screen instructions to install.  

When you are asked to create a user account and password, we suggest that you choose a Unix username that is that same as your SoC Unix username.  

## Launching WSL

To launch WSL, you can hit ++win+r++ and type in `Ubuntu` followed by ++enter++.  This should bring up the Unix command-line interface for you to interact with the Unix computing environment.

## Getting ready to install tools

WSL comes with `apt` as the package manager, which is a convenient way to list, search, install, update, and uninstall software and libraries in WSL.

After you have set up WSL, run the following:
```Bash
sudo apt update
```
What it does:

- `apt` is a command to install, upgrade, search, and uninstall software and other packages in Ubuntu.
- `apt update` asks `apt` to obtain the latest list of available packages from the Internet.
- `sudo` performs `apt update` with a super-user's level permission.  This command may ask you to enter your password.
   (Note: super-user means administrator in Unix).
