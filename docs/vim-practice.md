# Unit 12: Getting Started with `vim`

## Setting Up Your `vim` Environment

Like many other Unix programs, you can configure your preferences
by creating an `rc` (run commands) file in your home directory.
These `rc` files will be read by the corresponding programs and
executed line-by-line as if the text is entered into the program
through a keyboard.  You can view these `rc` as a script that will
be executed automatically whenever a program starts.

For `vim`, the `rc` file is called `.vimrc`.  The `.` in the front
of the file name carries a special meaning in Unix.  It means that
this file is hidden -- you won't see it when you `ls`.  Hiding the
run command files prevent your home directory from being cluttered.
To tell `ls` to show the hidden files, use the `-a` flag
```
$ ls -a
```

We have created a `.vimrc` file, with reasonable defaults, for your
use.  Note that different modules may choose to use a different coding convention and so a different setting.  But this `.vimrc` file
suffices for now.

To get this file,
```
$ cd
$ mv .vimrc .vimrc.bak
$ mkdir .backup
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nus-unix-workshop/2021-s1/master/.vimrc
```

The first line changes your working directory to your home.  The second line
creates a backup `.vimrc`, if one exists.  If it does not, `mv` will give you
an error, which is fine.  The third line creates a hidden backup directory
for `vim`.  The last line downloads our `.vimrc` into your
home directory.

Our default `.vimrc` set up `vim` such that it creates a backup copy of the
file you are editing every time and store it in `~/.backup`.  This feature has
saved me from pulling my hair out countless times.  It is highly recommended
that you set this up whenever you `vim`.

## Lesson 1: Navigation

Now, you can stay in your home directory or go back to your workshop
directory.

Download the following file for practice using `vim` in this session.
```
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nus-unix-workshop/2021-s1/master/jfk.txt
```

The file named `jfk.txt` should be downloaded.  Now let's start your first `vim` session.

```
$ vim jfk.txt
```

When you start, you will be in `NORMAL` mode.  For now, just move around the cursor with ++h++ ++j++ ++k++ ++l++.  Get comfortable with using the keys.

Next, try ++parenthesis-left++ and ++parenthesis-right++ to move forward
and backward, sentence-by-sentence.

Next, try ++brace-left++ and ++brace-right++ to move forward and backward, paragraph-by-paragraph.

Use ++0++ to jump to the beginning of the line, and ++dollar++ to
jump to the end of the line.

Use ++g+g++ to jump to the beginning of the file, and ++shift+g++ (`G`) to
jump to the last line of the file.

Now try ++slash++, type in any word (or prefix of a word) and ++enter++.  This should move the cursor to the beginning of the word.  You can use
++n++ and ++b++ to move to the next match and the previous match.

When you are comfortable with moving around, you can ++shift+z+z++ to
exit.

Congratulations, you have just completed your first session in `vim`!

## Lesson 2: Manipulating Text

Now, we are going to open up the same file again and try to
manipulate the text.  We are going to stay in the `NORMAL` mode
still.

```
$ vim jfk.txt
```

### Deletion

Try ++0++ ++d++ ++3++ ++w++ to move the cursor to the
beginning of the line and delete three words.

Press ++u++ to undo.  This is another lifesaver that
you should remember.

In `vim`, repeating the same command twice usually means
applying it to the whole line.  So ++d++ ++d++ deletes
the current line.  Try that.

Pairing a command with ++shift++ (or the capital letter
version) usually means applying the action until the end
of the line.  So ++shift+d++ deletes from the current
cursor until the end of the line.

### Copy Pasting

Hit ++p++ to paste back what you just deleted.  Try
moving the cursor to somewhere else and paste.

To copy (or yank) the current line, hit ++y++ ++y++.

Remember that all these commands can be composed using the
movement-action-movement pattern.  For instance,
++shift+9++ ++y++ ++shift+0++, which corresponds to: move
to the beginning of the sentence, yank, and until the end of
the sentence, basically copy the current sentence.

As you have seen in the ++d++ ++2++ ++w++ example,
you can preceed an action with a number to repeat
an action multiple times.

Try ++y++ ++y++ ++9++ ++p++.  You should be able
to understand what just happened!

### Deleting a Character

The ++x++ command deletes the current character.

Try this exercise: At the end of the file `jfk.txt`, there
are some typos:
```
libertyi. liberty.
```
Change `libertyi. liberty.` to `libtery.` by positioning the cursor on the second `i` and delete it.  Then use ++shift+d++ to
delete the extra `liberty.` at the end of the sentence.

### Visual Mode

In addition to the `INSERT` and `NORMAL` modes, `vim` has the third
mode, the `VISUAL` mode.  You can enter the `VISUAL` mode by
hitting ++v++.  Once in visual mode, you can move your cursor
to select the text and perform some actions on it (e.g., ++d++ or
++x++ to delete, ++y++ to yank).

Hitting ++shift+v++ will allow you to select line-by-line.

The `VISUAL` mode allows us to pipe the selected text to another
Unix command, and replace it with the result of that command.

Go ahead and try to select a paragraph in `jfk.txt`, and
hit ++colon++.  You will see that
```
:'<,'>
```
appears in the last line of the terminal.  At this point,
you can type in actions that you want to perform on the
selected text.  For instance,
```
:'<,'>w john.txt
```
will write it to a file named `john.txt`.

But, let's try the following:
```
:'<,'>!fmt
```

`!fmt` tells `vim` to invoke the shell and run `fmt`.
`fmt` is another simple small Unix utility that takes
in a text (from standard input) and spew out formatted
text in the standard output.  You will see that the width
of the text has changed to the default of 65.

You can try something that we have seen before.  Reselect
the text, and hit
```
:'<,'>!wc
```
The selected text will be replaced with the output from `wc`.

### The `:` command

You have seen examples of `:` commands for writing to a file or
piping selected text to an external command.

The `:` command also opens up a large number of actions you can do
in `vim`.  Here are a few essential yet simple commands.

- To jump to a line, hit ++colon++ followed by the line number.
- To open another file, hit ++colon++ and then type in `e <filename>`
- To find help on a topic, hit ++colon++ and then type in `help <keyword>`

Other advanced features such as search-and-replace, changing
preferences, splitting windows, opening new tabs, are also
accessible from the `:` command.

The `:` command prompt supports ++control+p++ and
++control+n++ for navigating back and forth your command history,
just like `bash`.  It also supports ++tab++ for auto-completion.

## Lesson 3: Insert mode!

Finally, we are going to try inserting some text.  Remember,
to use `INSERT` mode, we always start with a command ++i++ ++a++
++o++ or ++s++ (may paired with ++shift++) followed by the text that
you want to insert, followed by ++esc++.

Let's try ++i++ (insert).
Place your cursor anywhere,
hit ++i++, and start typing, when you are done.  Hit ++esc++.

You just added some text to the file.

Place your cursor anywhere,
hit ++a++ (append), and start typing, when you are done.  Hit ++esc++.
++a++ appends the text to the end of the current line.

Hit ++o++ (open) and start typing, when you are done.  Hit ++esc++.
++o++ opens up a new line for the your text.

Hit ++s++ (substitute) and start typing, when you are done.  Hit ++esc++.
++s++ substitute the current character with your text.

Now try it with ++shift++ and see the difference in behavior.

## Learning More

There is only so much we can cover in 30 minutes.  This workshop
only covers the tip of the iceberg.
To learn more about `vim`, we suggest that you run `vimtutor` on the command line
and follow through the tutorials.  

Once you are comfortable, you can soup up your `vim` with various
plugins and learn how to use advanced commands (such as search and
replace, jumping between files, recording macros, folding,
auto-completion) that are invaluable for programming.

There are also many video
tutorials and resources online.  Some interesting ones are:
