The world is very different now. For man holds in
his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of
human poverty and all forms of human life. And yet
the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears
fought are stall at issue around the globe -- the
belief that the rights of man come not from the
generosity of the state, but from the hand of God.

We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of
that first revolution. Let the word go forth from
this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that
the torch has been passed to a new generation of
Americans -- born in this century, tempered by war,
disciplined by a hard and bitter pace, proud of our
ancient heritage, and unwilling to witness or permit
the slow undoing of those humane rights to which this
nation has always been committed, and to which we
are committed today at home and around the world.

Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or
ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden,
meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any
foe, to assure the survival and the success of
libertyi. liberty.
